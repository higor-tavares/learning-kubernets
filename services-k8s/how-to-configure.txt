If you have a minikube installer and running, first of all
run `kubectl apply -f services-k8s/services.yml` to run 2 instances of nginx server
and then run  `kubectl apply -f services-k8s/nodeport.yml` to run nodeport that 
is like a loadbalance that you can run on localhost
then run the flowing command to redirect your localhost port to kubernets nodeport services
`kubectl port-forward svc/np-service ${any port you want}:80`
then acess localhost:${any port you want} and congratulations, 
you have a kubernets cluster runing successfuly with 2 pods in your machine!
